# Data and packages set-up

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(finalfit)
library(GGally) #ggpairs function
library(pROC)   # auc statistic
theme_set(theme_bw())

load("melanoma_factored.rda")
melanoma_data = mydata
rm(mydata)

# Tasks

-   create a fixed follow-up period variable (like 5-year mortality)

-   Feel free to explore and plot these data any way you wish!

-   For instance:

    -   Explore a univariable model of mortality \~ ulcer.factor
    -   Explore a univariable model of mortality \~ sex.factor
    -   Build a multivariable model of mortality against other variables.
    -   Explore interactions
